# Agent Workbench Goal Ledger

This ledger tracks whether TurnkeyAI is converging toward a production-grade
agent workbench for stable complex-task delivery. It is intentionally not a PR
counter or test-count scoreboard.

Update cadence:

- Add a checkpoint every 2-4 hours while actively working this goal.
- Add an extra checkpoint after any real LLM/browser E2E acceptance run.
- Every 24 hours, review the last day of checkpoints. If the same issue class
  keeps receiving local fixes without better real E2E outcomes, pause feature
  PRs and switch to methodology review.

Direction values:

- `converging`: user-visible behavior or real acceptance evidence moved closer
  to stable complex-task delivery.
- `oscillating`: local fixes are trading one failure mode for another, or
  apparent progress is not reflected in E2E behavior.
- `blocked`: forward progress is blocked by missing environment, missing
  credentials, external service outage, or an unresolved architecture decision.
- `unknown`: insufficient evidence; run acceptance or inspect production traces
  before claiming progress.

Checkpoint template:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm TZ - <short checkpoint name>

Direction: converging | oscillating | blocked | unknown

Execution Kernel:
- What changed in agent/tool/session execution semantics?
- Did this reduce loops, stuck runs, orphaned sessions, or ambiguous ownership?

Result Quality:
- Did final answers become more complete, evidence-backed, or actionable?
- Any regressions in substance, unsupported uncertainty, or weak synthesis?

Workbench UX:
- What did a user see that is clearer, faster, or more recoverable?
- Can the user tell whether work is running, stuck, blocked, done, or weak?

Browser Reliability:
- Did browser/session/transport behavior become more reliable or easier to
  diagnose?
- Any remaining profile, attach, reconnect, or bridge health issues?

Acceptance Evidence:
- Real E2E commands, mission IDs, validation IDs, screenshots, or manual test
  observations.
- If no real acceptance ran, say so explicitly and mark residual risk.

Regression Risk:
- What could this change break?
- Which tests or checks cover it, and which gaps remain?
```

## 2026-05-30 17:55 CST - Post-Acceptance Product Entry And Recovery Visibility

Direction: converging

Execution Kernel:
- No kernel semantics changed in this checkpoint. Recent kernel work already
  supports durable native tool calls, split tool results, session continuation,
  bounded browser continuity recovery, and mission completion classification.
- Current focus is making existing runtime truth visible and operable from the
  workbench rather than adding another execution path.

Result Quality:
- Latest real acceptance passed the mission matrix, including complex,
  follow-up, timeout-recovery, memory-recall, task-tracking,
  product-workbench-brief, and realistic-brief scenarios.
- Remaining quality risk is not solved by more page chrome: final answer
  substance still needs ongoing real-prompt validation when tool/browser work is
  long or partially degraded.

Workbench UX:
- First-run onboarding now surfaces bridge transport health from
  `/bridge/status`, so setup failure is visible before a user starts a
  browser-backed mission.
- Mission Detail is being extended to expose mission-scoped reconcile in place,
  because users should not have to leave a stuck mission and open Runtime just
  to force a thread/mission mirror pass.

Browser Reliability:
- Bridge status now carries transport health into both runtime surfaces and the
  first-run setup path.
- Browser continuity regression coverage verifies hot detach, lease movement,
  cold reopen, and single recovered-case behavior. Remaining risk is real
  environment variance: profile locks, unavailable CDP endpoints, and slow
  browser operations still require periodic real acceptance.

Acceptance Evidence:
- Latest full real acceptance command recorded in
  `docs/design/tool-runtime-completion-plan.md`:
  `npm run acceptance:real -- --model-catalog models.local.json --scenario-timeout-ms 300000 --cdp-timeout-ms 45000 --data-dir /tmp/turnkeyai-real-acceptance-20260530171334`
- Passed gates included tool-use real matrix, direct-CDP smoke, and full mission
  real matrix.
- Current Mission Detail reconcile slice has not yet passed UI smoke at this
  checkpoint; keep direction provisional until the PR verifies and merges.

Regression Risk:
- Product-entry health display is low risk and covered by typecheck, build,
  full test suite, Control Center smoke, and a focused route-failure unit test.
- Mission Detail reconcile risk is UI wiring only, but it touches a crowded
  workbench page. It needs Control Center smoke, typecheck, build, full tests,
  and PR review before merge.

## 24-Hour Review Rule

At least once per day while this goal is active:

1. Group the last 24 hours of issues by category:
   - execution loops or stuck work
   - weak or unsupported final answers
   - browser/session/transport instability
   - UI state mismatch or missing recovery action
   - acceptance environment drift
2. If the same category appears repeatedly and real E2E acceptance is not
   improving, stop feature PRs.
3. Write a methodology-review note before coding more fixes:
   - root cause hypothesis
   - why previous fixes did not converge
   - what architecture or harness change will prevent another local patch loop
   - which real E2E scenario must improve before resuming feature work
